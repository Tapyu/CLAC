# CLAC
CLAC (Cards Language with Audio/examples from Collins dictionary) is a [RPA](https://repoman.pl/en/why-robots-cost-so-much/#:~:text=What%20is%20RPA%3F) written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to automatically create language cards on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with audio/examples from [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/).

CLAC works on the following way:
1. Gather all text/audio information on Collins about the word that you are looking up. The information are:
    1. Meaning (Just the text).
    1. Different conjugations.
    1. Examples.
    1. Tag (verb, noun, phrasal verb, etc...) (Just text)
1. Create a new card on Anki in with the following structure:
    1. Front:
        1. Audio and text of the word for different conjugations.
        1. Audio and text of an examples
    1. back
        1. Text of the meaning

### FAQ
1. **Why CLAC isn't a Anki addon**? Because I do not have enough knowledge with [QT for py](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) to turn CLAC an addons. The current approach to learn about Anki addon is [some poor references](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/bae3yx/building_addons_without_reading_all_the_source/) or learning with the source code from other addons ðŸ˜‘. **I do not have time to do it**.

1. **How can I turn CLAC an addons**? If you are familiar with Anki addon development, you could exploit the web scraping performed on CLAC to collect the necessary information and create an Anki card using the Anki GUI itself. Just let me know making a pull request and let's work together ðŸ˜„.
